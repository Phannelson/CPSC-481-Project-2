    "## Problem:\n",
    "In this Logic Puzzle, Simon takes an \"adventure holiday\" every year with a friend to some new location within the United States. We determine each trip's activity, state and year, as well as the friend Simon went with. Develop an inference algorithm that checks possible solutions. The algorithm will be able to formulate each posible solution as a sentence, then apply an inference algorithm to ASK whether each sentence is entailed by the knowledge base.\n",
