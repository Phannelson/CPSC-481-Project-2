    "## Problem:\n",
    "In this Logic Puzzle, Simon takes an \"adventure holiday\" every year with a friend to some new location within the United States. We determine each trip's activity, state and year, as well as the friend Simon went with. Develop an inference algorithm that checks possible solutions. The algorithm will be able to formulate each posible solution as a sentence, then apply an inference algorithm to ASK whether each sentence is entailed by the knowledge base.\n",

    "## Our Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 1:\n",
    "Most of our code in main.py were commented out as the approach was not feasible in creating the logic puzzle and an inference algorithm. We constructed the logic puzzle using a nested dictionary, which we realized would not work with adding possible combinations in each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The T_check function was also a bit too long since it checked each cell and then check the other 6 cells within that row & column. If the cell was true it would mark there other cells false (similar to sudoku). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "For our algorithm, we decided to use Model Checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools:\n",
    "* utils.py from github code\n",
